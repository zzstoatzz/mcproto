## AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol) – Philosophy and Architecture

 ([File:Bluesky–AT Protocol federation architecture.svg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bluesky%E2%80%93AT_Protocol_federation_architecture.svg)) **Decentralized Social Networking:** The AT Protocol (atproto) is a federated social networking framework designed with **decentralization, user ownership, and interoperability** as core principles. Instead of a single server or company controlling user data, many servers (Personal Data Servers, or PDS) can participate – users can choose or run their own PDS while still being part of one unified network ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=paper%20we%20introduce%20the%20architecture,approaches%20in%20social%20media%20moderation)) ([AT Protocol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol#:~:text=The%20AT%20Protocol%20aims%20to,7)). This design lets multiple providers host content and identities, preventing any single point of control and enabling seamless movement between providers. The focus is on **data sovereignty** (users retain control of their identity and content) and **portability** – for example, a user can switch to a different PDS without losing their social graph or content ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=paper%20we%20introduce%20the%20architecture,approaches%20in%20social%20media%20moderation)). The protocol addresses challenges seen in other decentralized systems (like difficult user experience and poor interoperability) by providing a common, modular platform that can scale to large numbers of users ([AT Protocol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol#:~:text=The%20AT%20Protocol%20aims%20to,7)) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=%2A%20Self,primitives%20from%20the%20web%20platform)). Key philosophical tenets include: 

- **Decentralization & Interoperability:** Any compliant server can join to serve user content; platforms interconnect by sharing data formats and streams. This means all servers form *one social network*, much like how different email providers interoperate ([Paul Frazee on Bluesky and ATProto](https://www.softwaresessions.com/episodes/atproto/#:~:text=,functionally%20as%20one%20shared%20application)) ([AT Protocol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol#:~:text=The%20AT%20Protocol%20aims%20to,80%20content%20formatted%20as%20predefined)). Apps built on atproto fetch and serve content in predefined schemas so that posts, profiles, follows, etc., are understood across the network ([AT Protocol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol#:~:text=architecture%20and%20a%20federated%20%2C,7)).  
- **Identity Ownership:** Users have a portable, self-owned identity secured by cryptography. Rather than being tied to a specific server, identity is maintained via decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and can be verified through external proofs (like domain names), ensuring you truly “own” your handle and can move it as needed ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Identity%3A%20account%20control%20is%20rooted,and%20mutable%20identifier%20for%20accounts)).  
- **Data Sovereignty:** Content you create (posts, follows, etc.) lives in a personal **repository** that you control, hosted on your chosen server. The data is **self-authenticating** – signed with your keys – so it remains verifiable and yours even if copied elsewhere ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=%2A%20Self,primitives%20from%20the%20web%20platform)) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=repository%20are%20organized%20into%20a,verification%20key%20for%20this%20signature)). Users can export or migrate their entire repository to a new host if desired, without losing data or identity ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=match%20at%20L410%20by%20copying,posts%20or%20their%20social%20graph)).  
- **Modularity & Open Ecosystem:** The protocol is minimal and generic; higher-level social features are defined in **lexicons** (schema definitions) that anyone can extend ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=The%20AT%20Protocol%20itself%20does,namespace)) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=The%20core%20protocol%20extension%20mechanism,mobile%20apps%20or%20web%20interfaces)). This enables interoperability (common schemas) while allowing innovation (new types of records or apps can be introduced under new namespaces). The ecosystem is designed so that communities or third parties can contribute services like moderation, search (App Views), or custom feed algorithms on top of the shared data layer ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=The%20core%20protocol%20extension%20mechanism,mobile%20apps%20or%20web%20interfaces)) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=It%20is%20expected%20that%20third,authority)).  

### Identity Verification – DIDs, Handles, and Trust Layers

**Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Atproto uses DIDs as the canonical identity for accounts. A DID is a globally unique string (e.g. `did:plc:abcd1234...`) associated with a user, which resolves to a **DID document** containing metadata like the user’s public keys and service endpoints ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=unique%20identifier%3A%20a%20decentralized%20ID,DIDs%20are%20a%20recent%20W3C)). Because the DID document lists the account’s current PDS server and public verification key, it decouples identity from any single server – if you move to a new server, you just update the DID document, and others can still find you via the same DID ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=unique%20identifier%3A%20a%20decentralized%20ID,DIDs%20are%20a%20recent%20W3C)) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=by%20copying%20their%20repository%20and,posts%20or%20their%20social%20graph)). The DID itself is generated by a network **PLC (Portable Data) Directory** in Bluesky’s implementation, ensuring each is unique and tamper-resistant.

**Handles (Human-readable IDs):** To make identities user-friendly, atproto introduces **handles**, which look like domain names or email (e.g. `alice.example.com` or `bob.bsky.social`). A handle maps to a DID through a couple of trust layers: the owner of a domain can prove linkage to a DID by publishing it in a DNS TXT record or at a special `/.well-known` URL ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=To%20prove%20ownership%20of%20a,handle%2C%20as%20shown%20in%20Figure%C2%A02)). Conversely, the DID document includes the handle it’s tied to, creating a bidirectional verification ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=To%20prove%20ownership%20of%20a,handle%2C%20as%20shown%20in%20Figure%C2%A02)) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=A%20link%20from%20the%20DID,when%20the%20DID%20is%20resolved)). For example, if Alice owns the domain `alice.com` and sets her handle to that domain, she can put her DID in `alice.com`’s DNS; her DID document will in turn list `alice.com` as her handle. This two-way check ensures **handle ownership is verified** by control of the DNS domain ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=To%20prove%20ownership%20of%20a,handle%2C%20as%20shown%20in%20Figure%C2%A02)). Users who don’t have their own domain can use a handle provided by their server (like `user.bluesky.social`), which that server’s handle service vouches for. 

**Trust Through Handles and DIDs:** This handle/DID system introduces layers of trust: if a handle is a custom domain, trust is bootstrapped from the DNS system (which the domain owner controls). If it’s a default handle (like on a big provider), users trust that provider’s directory. The **strongest trust signal** is a handle on a domain you recognize (e.g. `nytimes.com` would indicate the New York Times account) – it’s an **out-of-band verification** via DNS authority ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=Handle%20%28e,did%3Aweb%20or%20did%3Aplc%20directory%20server)) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=To%20prove%20ownership%20of%20a,handle%2C%20as%20shown%20in%20Figure%C2%A02)). Meanwhile, the DID ensures that even if a server is untrusted or compromised, an attacker cannot hijack the identity without also having the user’s private key. All operations (posting, following) are signed by the DID’s key, so others can cryptographically verify that actions truly came from that user ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Identity%3A%20account%20control%20is%20rooted,and%20mutable%20identifier%20for%20accounts)) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Data%3A%20public%20content%20is%20stored,signed%20and%20distributed%20outside%20repositories)). This combination of human-readable handle + cryptographic DID provides a **web-of-trust foundation**: trust the domain for the name, trust the DID for consistency and security. Additional layers (like reputation services or attestations) can be built on top of this foundation, but atproto’s base ensures identities are portable and verifiable.

### Data Storage & Retrieval – Repositories, PDS, and Lexicons

**Personal Repositories:** In AT Protocol, each user account has a **repository** – a personal data store of all their content (posts, likes, follows, etc.) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=All%20data%20that%20a%20user,CBOR%C2%A0%28Protocol)) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=Each%20user%20account%20has%20one,all%20of%20the%20actions%20they)). Repositories are essentially **Merkle trees** (specifically *Merkle Search Trees*) of data records ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=repository%20are%20organized%20into%20a,verification%20key%20for%20this%20signature)). Every time you make a change (e.g. create a post or delete something), a new tree root is generated and **signed with your private key** ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=repository%20are%20organized%20into%20a,verification%20key%20for%20this%20signature)). This means the data is tamper-evident and content-addressed: every record has a CID (content hash), and the signed root ensures the integrity of the whole dataset. If a record is removed, cryptographic proofs can show it no longer exists in the latest state ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=order%C2%A0%28Auvolat%20and%20Ta%C3%AFani%2C%202019%29,verification%20key%20for%20this%20signature)). Since records are content-addressed and signed, anyone fetching your data can verify it hasn’t been altered and indeed comes from you. Media (binary blobs like images) are stored outside the Merkle tree (for efficiency) but are referenced by hashes from within records ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=a%20repository%20may%20contain%20a,from%20a%20record%20in)).

**Personal Data Servers (PDS):** A PDS is the server that **hosts a user’s repository** and acts on behalf of the user on the network ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Network%3A%20HTTP%20client,outputs%20a%20unified%20event%20Firehose)). The PDS exposes an HTTPS API (and WebSocket streams) so others can fetch the user’s records or subscribe to updates. In effect, the PDS is your account’s **agent** on the network, answering queries (like “give me Alice’s posts”) and routing your signed operations to other servers ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Network%3A%20HTTP%20client,outputs%20a%20unified%20event%20Firehose)). Because identity is portable, a user can migrate their repository to a new PDS at any time: they copy the repo data to the new server and update their DID document to point to the new PDS URL ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=match%20at%20L410%20by%20copying,posts%20or%20their%20social%20graph)). This design ensures **data persistence** even if a given host goes down or if the user leaves a provider. Other servers and aggregators continuously crawl or subscribe to PDS feeds to stay up to date with all user records (the aggregate feed of all new records in the network is called the “firehose”) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Network%3A%20HTTP%20client,outputs%20a%20unified%20event%20Firehose)). The federation is flexible: large providers might host many users’ PDS instances, and individual users or small communities might run their own. All these PDSes speak the same protocol, so they interoperate seamlessly.

**Lexicons (Schemas) and XRPC:** Rather than hard-coding social features, atproto relies on **lexicons** – JSON-based schema definitions that describe data models (like “posts”, “profiles”) and procedures (APIs) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Data%3A%20public%20content%20is%20stored,signed%20and%20distributed%20outside%20repositories)) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=The%20AT%20Protocol%20itself%20does,namespace)). Each lexicon is identified by a namespaced identifier (NSID, e.g. `app.bsky.feed.post`) and defines the structure of a record or an API method. This approach means that applications can introduce new features by publishing a new lexicon, without requiring a fork of the whole protocol ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=The%20core%20protocol%20extension%20mechanism,mobile%20apps%20or%20web%20interfaces)). For example, Bluesky’s social app defines lexicons for microblogging posts under the `app.bsky.*` namespace, but a different app could define, say, `com.example.photo.album` lexicon for photo albums – and users could include both posts and photo albums in their single repository. Servers and clients use these lexicon schemas to validate data and ensure **interoperability**: any client that knows the lexicon can interact with that data type. The protocol’s network API, called **XRPC** (for “Lexicon-defined RPC”), uses these lexicons to describe endpoints. In practice, all inter-server and client-server calls (fetching posts, liking a post, etc.) are defined in lexicons and use JSON/CBOR data that matches those schemas ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Data%3A%20public%20content%20is%20stored,signed%20and%20distributed%20outside%20repositories)). This makes the system **extensible** – new capabilities can be added by anyone via new lexicons, and multiple applications can reuse each other’s lexicons and data. 

*Retrieval:* To fetch data, a client typically queries a known PDS (for example, to get Alice’s profile, query Alice’s PDS via the handle/DID resolution). The PDS responds with records (in the agreed schema) or a stream of events. For global views like searching content or aggregating posts from many users, **indexer services (relays or App Views)** come into play. A **Relay** subscribes to the firehose of many PDSes and maintains a cached mirror of all public records ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=match%20at%20L468%20replica%20of,latency%20notifications)). It can then feed those into services like a **Feed generator** or **App View** which composes and filters content (e.g., generating a custom timeline, or performing full-text search) ([Call for Developer Projects · bluesky-social atproto · Discussion #3049 · GitHub](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions/3049#:~:text=Reviews%20and%20Recommendations%3A%20a%20broad,used%20to%20bootstrap%20social%20recommendations)) ([File:Bluesky–AT Protocol federation architecture.svg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bluesky%E2%80%93AT_Protocol_federation_architecture.svg#:~:text=Description%20Bluesky%E2%80%93AT%20Protocol%20federation%20architecture)). The open design allows third-party services to offer alternative views or moderation on top of the same underlying data. Ultimately, any piece of content in the network can be referenced by a global identifier (an AT URI, which includes the DID of the publisher and the record’s key) and retrieved as long as you know a server or service that has indexed it ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Network%3A%20HTTP%20client,outputs%20a%20unified%20event%20Firehose)).

### Decentralized Trust and Reputation Mechanisms

AT Protocol’s design acknowledges that **trust and moderation** should be decentralized and configurable by the user. Instead of a single company setting the rules, the network enables multiple sources of truth for what content or users are considered trustworthy, safe, or reputable. Here are possible models and primitives that atproto supports or inspires:

- **Labeling System (Composable Moderation):** Atproto includes a built-in **labels** feature for attaching metadata to content or accounts. A label is basically a small assertion like a tag (e.g. “nsfw”, “spam”, or “trusted”) issued by a certain source (identified by their DID) about a certain subject (a record or user DID) ([Labels - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/label#:~:text=Labels%20are%20a%20form%20of,content%20in%20the%20atproto%20ecosystem)). Labels are **self-authenticated** objects (digitally signed by the issuer) and distributed separately from the main content feeds ([Labels - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/label#:~:text=They%20exist%20as%20free,labels)). This means **anyone can act as a moderation or reputation service** by publishing labels – for example, a community trust service could label known bot accounts or a fact-checking org could label misinformation posts. Users or applications then choose which label sources to trust and apply (composable moderation) ([Labels - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/label#:~:text=The%20label%20concept%20and%20protocol,other%20purposes%20in%20atproto%20applications)). For instance, your client might be configured to trust labels from “Anti-Spam Coalition (DID XYZ)” and thus hide any content they label as “spam”, but you might opt out of another group's labels. This creates a decentralized reputation layer: instead of one global “score,” there are many labelers and you decide whose judgment to utilize. The label mechanism was explicitly designed to enable these kinds of community-driven moderation and reputation signals ([Labels - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/label#:~:text=The%20label%20concept%20and%20protocol,other%20purposes%20in%20atproto%20applications)). 

- **Domain Verification as Trust Signal:** Because handles can be domain names, there is an implicit trust/reputation system via DNS. An account with a custom domain handle suggests the owner controls that domain (e.g., `@alice.com` means the user proved control of **alice.com**). This can serve as a form of identity trust: for well-known organizations or individuals, their domain acts like a verified badge because one can independently verify their domain ownership (similar to how DNS-based verification works for email or website identity) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=To%20prove%20ownership%20of%20a,handle%2C%20as%20shown%20in%20Figure%C2%A02)) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=A%20link%20from%20the%20DID,when%20the%20DID%20is%20resolved)). At the protocol level, this is binary (either the DNS link is valid or not), but socially it means some handles carry more credibility (e.g., an account claiming to be a news outlet is far more credible if using the outlet’s official domain as handle, versus a random server). This leverages the existing web-of-trust in DNS and can be thought of as **decentralized verification**, since no central authority is needed—just the DNS system and the protocol’s checks.

- **Web-of-Trust and Social Graph Endorsements (Possible Extension):** In a fully decentralized network, users could build **trust networks** by leveraging follows or explicit endorsements. For example, one could imagine a system where users sign statements vouching for other users, forming a web-of-trust graph. While atproto doesn’t natively implement PGP-style web-of-trust for identity, the follow graph inherently provides a social trust signal (who you follow might indicate who you find trustworthy or relevant). The Bluesky team has noted that the existing **social graph** could be used to bootstrap trust-based services ([Call for Developer Projects · bluesky-social atproto · Discussion #3049 · GitHub](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions/3049#:~:text=Reviews%20and%20Recommendations%3A%20a%20broad,used%20to%20bootstrap%20social%20recommendations)). For instance, a ranking algorithm might boost content from accounts followed by people you follow, as a way to surface trusted content (assuming people tend to follow those they trust). Beyond the follow graph, custom lexicons could be created to explicitly record trust assertions or ratings, and those could be analyzed by clients or services to inform user experience. This model would distribute reputation judgments among users themselves.

- **Open Algorithmic Ranking and Reputation Services:** Atproto envisions an ecosystem of **pluggable algorithms** (via the App View/Feed Generator system). This means different services can supply different ways of ordering or filtering content. One such service could incorporate reputation scores – for example, a feed generator could down-rank posts from accounts known to be malicious or up-rank those with good community reputation. Because the data is all open, third parties can build reputation metrics: e.g., counting how often a user is blocked by others, or analyzing engagement authenticity. **Ozone** (an open-source project in the Bluesky community) is one example of exploring reputation to mitigate fake accounts and manipulation ([Call for Developer Projects · bluesky-social atproto · Discussion #3049 · GitHub](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions/3049#:~:text=Reviews%20and%20Recommendations%3A%20a%20broad,used%20to%20bootstrap%20social%20recommendations)). Using a mix of label data, social graph metrics, and content analysis, these independent services can offer users choices on how to filter noise and find trustworthy information. Importantly, **users have agency**: they can choose which filters or reputation services to subscribe to, rather than being subject to one monolithic algorithm.

In summary, atproto doesn’t enforce a single trust or reputation system – instead, it provides primitives (DID-based identity, verifiable handles, labels, an open feed architecture) that enable **multiple decentralized trust mechanisms** to flourish. An MVP implementation might start simply (e.g., using labels to mark trusted vs untrusted content, or only trusting certain domain handles), and over time incorporate more complex web-of-trust or reputation scoring systems as those components are developed by the community ([Call for Developer Projects · bluesky-social atproto · Discussion #3049 · GitHub](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions/3049#:~:text=Reviews%20and%20Recommendations%3A%20a%20broad,used%20to%20bootstrap%20social%20recommendations)). The guiding philosophy is that **moderation and trust are “stackable”** and configurable: the network supplies raw information and verifications, and end-users or communities decide whose judgment to trust for the content they consume.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Philosophy and Design for AI Connectivity

 ([Hackteam - Build Your First MCP Server with TypeScript](https://hackteam.io/blog/build-your-first-mcp-server-with-typescript-in-under-10-minutes/)) **Standardizing AI-Agent Connectivity:** The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard (introduced by Anthropic in late 2024) aimed at connecting AI assistants (like LLM-based agents) with external data sources and tools in a **uniform, interoperable way** ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20addresses%20this%20challenge,to%20the%20data%20they%20need)) ([About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.linkup.so/blog/model-context-protocol-here-is-the-leap-to-the-agentic-world#:~:text=Historically%2C%20developers%20have%20tackled%20this,of%20dynamic%20and%20contextual%20intelligence)). The philosophy behind MCP is comparable to a “**USB-C for AI**” – a single, standardized interface that replaces countless bespoke integrations ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20addresses%20this%20challenge,to%20the%20data%20they%20need)) ([About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.linkup.so/blog/model-context-protocol-here-is-the-leap-to-the-agentic-world#:~:text=changes%20this%20paradigm%20entirely,of%20dynamic%20and%20contextual%20intelligence)). Previously, if you wanted a chatbot to access, say, a database and a web API, you had to wire up custom code for each. MCP instead defines a common protocol so that any AI client can connect to any data/tool service that speaks MCP. This dramatically improves interoperability and reuse: an AI agent can **gain capabilities by simply plugging into new MCP servers**, without custom coding each integration ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20addresses%20this%20challenge,to%20the%20data%20they%20need)) ([About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.linkup.so/blog/model-context-protocol-here-is-the-leap-to-the-agentic-world#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20MCP%20is,Key%20features%20of%20MCP%20include)). The core philosophy centers on:

- **Standardization of Interfaces:** MCP formalizes how an AI agent (client) should talk to an external resource (server) – using a fixed JSON-RPC-based message format and well-defined interaction patterns. This standard covers how to list available actions, invoke them, stream results, etc., in a way that’s not tied to any one AI model or one data source ([MCP – Model Context Protocol: Standardizing AI-Data Access - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sreeni5018/mcp-model-context-protocol-standardizing-ai-data-access-465#:~:text=data%20sources%20such%20as%20databases%2C,APIs%2C%20and%20file%20systems)) ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=MCP%20consists%20of%20two%20components%3A,but%20still%20supports%20remote%20APIs)). By providing a consistent interface, MCP lets developers and companies build connectors in a predictable way. An MCP-compliant database connector or GitHub connector, for example, can be used by *any* AI system that implements an MCP client, not just Claude. This is analogous to how any web browser can talk to any web server because HTTP is a shared standard.

- **Two-Way Communication (Tools, not just Data):** A key aspect is that MCP isn’t just about the AI reading data; it’s also about enabling AI to take actions. It establishes a **two-way channel** where the AI can request operations (like “fetch this file” or “post a message to Slack”) and receive results ([Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP): The Standard for AI Interaction - DEV Community](https://dev.to/foxgem/claudes-model-context-protocol-mcp-the-standard-for-ai-interaction-5gko#:~:text=,powered)) ([Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP): The Standard for AI Interaction - DEV Community](https://dev.to/foxgem/claudes-model-context-protocol-mcp-the-standard-for-ai-interaction-5gko#:~:text=and%20relevant%20information.%20%2A%20Two,unauthorized%20access%20to%20external%20resources)). In other words, it treats external functionalities as extensions of the AI’s capabilities (often called “tools”). This two-way interactivity is critical for *agentic* behavior – AI systems that can act on the world, not merely answer questions. MCP’s design separates out three concepts that an AI can leverage from a server ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=Image%3A%20MCP%20architecture)) ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=,only%20data%2C%20similar%20to%20file)): **Tools** (active operations or API calls it can perform), **Resources** (passive data it can retrieve, like files or database queries), and **Prompts** (predefined prompt templates or instructions that help the AI interact with the tool effectively). This standard breakdown means any MCP server can advertise what it can do in terms of these elements, and any client knows how to interpret and use them.

- **Dynamic, Real-Time Context:** By allowing AI agents to fetch fresh data on demand, MCP effectively **bridges the gap between static trained knowledge and live information** ([About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.linkup.so/blog/model-context-protocol-here-is-the-leap-to-the-agentic-world#:~:text=by%20modern%20AI%20systems%2C%20particularly,date%20information)) ([About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.linkup.so/blog/model-context-protocol-here-is-the-leap-to-the-agentic-world#:~:text=,with%20external%20datasets%20or%20applications)). An AI with MCP can have up-to-date context (e.g., latest documents, current database state, recent emails) instead of being limited to its training data. MCP servers can feed real-time updates or allow queries, which the AI can incorporate into its reasoning. This *dynamic contextuality* ensures AI responses remain relevant and factual as underlying data changes ([About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.linkup.so/blog/model-context-protocol-here-is-the-leap-to-the-agentic-world#:~:text=,with%20external%20datasets%20or%20applications)). It’s similar to how tools like web browsing or plugins work for some chatbots, but MCP provides an open, general way to do it.

- **Open Source and Collaborative Ecosystem:** MCP is released as open source, with SDKs in multiple languages (TypeScript, Python, etc.), and has a growing community providing connectors to common systems ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=,source%20repository%20of%20MCP%20servers)). The design encourages organizations to share and reuse MCP servers. For example, Anthropic provided reference servers for Google Drive, Slack, Git, GitHub, databases, etc., and others are contributing their own ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Claude%203,GitHub%2C%20Git%2C%20Postgres%2C%20and%20Puppeteer)). Because it’s a free and open standard, it lowers the barrier for connecting AI to new tools – anyone can implement the spec for their particular system and instantly make that available to all MCP-compatible AI. This collaborative approach is meant to create a rich ecosystem of capabilities that advance AI usefulness universally ([About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.linkup.so/blog/model-context-protocol-here-is-the-leap-to-the-agentic-world#:~:text=making%20responses%20and%20insights%20more,relevant%20and%20accurate)) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=exploring%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20sharing%20pre,GitHub%2C%20Git%2C%20Postgres%2C%20and%20Puppeteer)).

In sum, the MCP core philosophy is to **enable AI agents to seamlessly interface with the world of software and data** by establishing common ground. It treats external systems as modular plugins to an AI – standardizing how they’re described and invoked – which both simplifies development and scales AI integration in a sustainable way ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20addresses%20this%20challenge,to%20the%20data%20they%20need)) ([About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.linkup.so/blog/model-context-protocol-here-is-the-leap-to-the-agentic-world#:~:text=changes%20this%20paradigm%20entirely,of%20dynamic%20and%20contextual%20intelligence)). The hope is that by doing so, AI assistants can evolve from isolated text generators into fully-fledged agents that can reliably interact with real-world systems.

### MCP Servers and Capabilities – Registration and Exposure of Functions

**Architecture Overview:** MCP follows a simple client-server architecture. An **MCP *server*** is a process or service that exposes some set of functionalities (tools, resources, prompts) to AI agents, and an **MCP *client*** is the component (usually within an AI application or host) that connects to servers to use those functionalities ([MCP – Model Context Protocol: Standardizing AI-Data Access - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sreeni5018/mcp-model-context-protocol-standardizing-ai-data-access-465#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20MCP%20standardizes,Developers%20can)) ([MCP – Model Context Protocol: Standardizing AI-Data Access - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sreeni5018/mcp-model-context-protocol-standardizing-ai-data-access-465#:~:text=1.%20MCP%20Hosts%20%E2%80%93%20AI,calculations%20or%20user%20profile%20management)). The AI model itself (the host, e.g. Claude or another LLM-based app) uses the MCP client to interface with servers. In practice, a typical flow might be: the user runs or specifies an MCP server (say a “calendar server” or “database server”), then the AI application’s MCP client connects to it. Crucially, **servers advertise their capabilities**, and clients discover them on connection ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=MCP%20consists%20of%20two%20components%3A,but%20still%20supports%20remote%20APIs)) ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=)).

**Capability Advertisement (Discovery):** When an MCP client connects to a server, the first step is an **initialization handshake** where the server describes what it can do. The MCP protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 as the message format over various transports (it can run over a local stdio, TCP socket, etc.) ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=MCP%20consists%20of%20two%20components%3A,but%20still%20supports%20remote%20APIs)) ([MCP – Model Context Protocol: Standardizing AI-Data Access - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sreeni5018/mcp-model-context-protocol-standardizing-ai-data-access-465#:~:text=MCP%20supports%20two%20transport%20models%2C,0%20for%20structured%20data%20exchange)). In the handshake, the client typically sends an `"initialize"` request, and the server replies with details about its **capabilities and info** ([MCP JSON-RPC Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/p33upo55dp#:~:text=,request)). For example, the server’s response might include its name/version and a list of all **tools** (functions) it provides, each with a name and a description or schema of parameters, plus any available **resources** (data endpoints) and **prompt templates** it offers ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=,only%20data%2C%20similar%20to%20file)) ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=)). This essentially acts as the server’s self-registration: the client learns, “This server can do X, Y, Z.” 

- *Tools:* These are operations the AI can invoke. A tool might be “search the web” or “query database” or “send email,” depending on the server’s purpose ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=,only%20data%2C%20similar%20to%20file)). Tools are described in a standardized way (including input parameters and return types), so the AI can formulate a JSON-RPC call to execute them. Because of MCP’s standardization, the AI host can, for instance, automatically present these tools to the language model (possibly as function calls in the model’s API) or incorporate them into its planning. Tools essentially turn APIs into functions the AI can call at will, through the MCP server acting as an intermediary.

- *Resources:* These are typically read-only data sources exposed in a uniform way (like a virtual file system or database queries). For example, a server might list a resource like `file://logs/app.log` or `db://customers/orders` that the AI can ask to retrieve ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=,postgres%3A%2F%2Fdatabase%2Fusers)). The idea is to give the AI structured access to data, where it can say “open this resource” and get back the content. Resources let the AI browse information in a controlled manner (often paired with the tools, e.g., a `FileSystem` resource combined with a `readFile` tool).

- *Prompts:* MCP also allows servers to supply **prompt templates or presets** – think of them as suggested ways to ask the AI to do certain tasks. For instance, a GitHub server might provide a “generate commit message” prompt template ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=Because%20tools%20follow%20a%20common,postgres%3A%2F%2Fdatabase%2Fusers)), or a SQL server might have a “summarize query results” prompt. These help standardize interactions: the AI can use a prompt template to better interact with the tool (perhaps providing it with an optimal instruction format). They’re optional aids that the client can surface to the user or apply internally to structure the AI’s requests to tools.

The **initialization discovery** typically yields a data structure containing lists of the above. In other words, by connecting to an MCP server, the AI automatically “knows” what actions it can take with that server ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=)) ([MCP JSON-RPC Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/p33upo55dp#:~:text=,request)). This design is very much like plugging in a device and the device telling the system what it is (like USB plug-and-play). Each tool or resource is analogous to an endpoint on a traditional API, but MCP formalizes how they’re listed and invoked so that *any* AI agent can use them without custom code.

**Server Registration in Practice:** Currently, MCP is in an early stage where most connections are manually configured (especially since it’s local-first). For example, in Claude’s desktop app (an MCP host), a user might select or install an MCP server (like a “Slack connector”) and the app will launch/connect to that server, performing the handshake. The server doesn’t “broadcast” its existence on a network by itself; rather, it’s made available to an AI host by configuration. However, as the ecosystem grows, one can imagine a **registry of MCP servers** (which is where atproto could come in – see next section) or discovery mechanisms where servers announce themselves. At minimum, though, the protocol ensures that once a connection is made, the **MCP client can enumerate everything the server offers** in a systematic way ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=)). From that point on, whenever the AI needs to use a capability, the client issues a JSON-RPC call to the server (e.g. `"method": "tool/run", "params": { ... }`) and the server executes the request and returns the result. The AI model might request user permission depending on the action (since using a tool could have side-effects), but the low-level invocation is handled by MCP.

It’s worth noting that MCP supports multiple transport models: running servers locally (e.g., as subprocesses) or remotely over networking. In both cases, JSON-RPC is used, but local STDIO transport is convenient for local tools, whereas TCP or other transports would be used for remote servers ([MCP – Model Context Protocol: Standardizing AI-Data Access - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sreeni5018/mcp-model-context-protocol-standardizing-ai-data-access-465#:~:text=MCP%20supports%20two%20transport%20models%2C,0%20for%20structured%20data%20exchange)). The **capabilities advertisement** remains the same, making remote and local tools functionally identical from the AI’s perspective. The result is that an AI host can connect to many servers at once and **aggregate a wide capability set** – for instance, one server for files, one for web browsing, one for a database – all discovered and invoked through the common MCP interface ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=MCP%20consists%20of%20two%20components%3A,but%20still%20supports%20remote%20APIs)) ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=a%20database%2C%20or%20making%20API,but%20still%20supports%20remote%20APIs)).

### Authentication and Access Control in MCP

**Current Security Model:** As MCP is new, the initial implementations prioritize ease of integration, often running servers locally with the AI host. In this default scenario, security is simplified: since everything is on the user’s machine, the primary concern is to **isolate sensitive credentials and actions within the MCP server**. The server might hold API keys or database passwords to perform its duties, but the AI host does not directly see those – it only sees the high-level tool interface ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=Image%3A%20MCP%20initialization)). Moreover, actions typically require **explicit user approval** in current UIs. For example, if an AI tries to use a “send email” tool, the client could prompt the user “Allow AI to send an email via Gmail connector?” before actually invoking it. This user-in-the-loop approach mitigates risk when tools can have side effects, especially given that these setups are often local prototypes.

Because MCP was initially “local-first” (not exposing open endpoints over the internet), simple trust (or OS-level permissions) were considered sufficient. The Anthropic team notes that *for now* MCP is best seen as a prototyping tool in terms of security, and remote or multi-user authentication wasn’t fully fleshed out in the first release ([Anthropic's Model Context Protocol: Building an 'ODBC for AI' in an ...](https://salesforcedevops.net/index.php/2024/11/29/anthropics-model-context-protocol/#:~:text=Anthropic%27s%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%3A%20Building,standard%20rather%20than%20a)). In fact, one limitation identified is the lack of a robust authentication scheme for remote MCP servers – meaning, if you wanted to connect to an MCP server running on a different host or as a cloud service, how do you authenticate the client and server to each other? This is actively being worked on ([How to use Anthropic MCP Server with open LLMs, OpenAI or Google Gemini](https://www.philschmid.de/mcp-example-llama#:~:text=and%20reused%20across%20different%20platforms,the%20need%20to%20copy%20code)).

**Authentication Approaches Under Development:** For MCP to be used in a distributed environment, it will need mechanisms analogous to API keys, OAuth tokens, or mutual authentication. Possible approaches include:

- Each MCP server requiring an **authentication token or key** from clients. For example, when starting an MCP server, you might configure a secret, and any client must provide that secret in the initialize handshake (perhaps as part of the JSON-RPC params or an out-of-band channel). This would be similar to how one protects a JSON-RPC API with a password. JSON-RPC doesn’t have a built-in auth header since it’s transport-agnostic, so it might rely on transport-level security (e.g., TLS client certs or an SSH tunnel) or an initial auth method call.

- **User Authentication for Data Access:** Many MCP servers are fronts to third-party APIs (like Google Drive or Slack). In those cases, the server itself often needs credentials (OAuth tokens, etc.) to access the service on behalf of a user. A secure design would have the **user authenticate directly with the data source**, and then the MCP server stores the resulting token. For instance, a remote MCP server could implement OAuth login flows: the user grants access to their Google Drive, the MCP server obtains a token, and then it can serve the AI’s requests to Google Drive. Ensuring that only authorized parties can connect to use that token is critical – the server shouldn’t respond to just any client that connects unless it knows the client (the AI) is acting for the legitimate user. One idea could be that the MCP client presents a user-specific token when connecting, or connections are one-to-one (the user’s instance of an AI connects to the user’s instance of the MCP server, both under the user’s control).

- **Encryption and Integrity:** Since MCP may run over networks, using **TLS/SSL** for transport will be important to prevent eavesdropping or tampering with the JSON-RPC messages. If an MCP server is hosted on some cloud endpoint, it should be behind HTTPS or WSS (secure WebSocket) so that the content (which could be sensitive data being fetched) is protected in transit. The MCP spec likely will outline recommended practices for securing the channel (similar to any API service).

- **Authorization and Scoping:** Fine-grained access control is another angle – an MCP server might expose multiple tools, some of which should only be used by certain roles. In a simple personal setup, the “role” is just the user themselves. But consider a multi-tenant MCP server in an enterprise: it may need to enforce that AI #1 can only access subset of data relevant to user A, etc. While not implemented yet, future versions might include an **authentication context** in requests, and the server can check permissions. For instance, including a user ID or an auth token in each call to ensure the AI is permitted to perform that action (just like an API would verify a token’s scopes).

**MCP Identity and Trust:** One interesting possibility is using **mutual authentication** – e.g., using a client certificate or a DID (decentralized ID) to authenticate an MCP client to a server and vice versa. This is where integration with atproto could be powerful: if the AI agent (or the user controlling it) has a DID, and the MCP server also has a DID or is associated with the user’s DID, they could use a challenge-response with those keys to authenticate. While this isn’t in the MCP spec yet, it’s conceptually feasible to say: the MCP server trusts connections signed by a certain user’s private key. Then the AI client, acting for that user, could sign an authentication payload with the user’s atproto key to prove “I am user X” (we’ll discuss this more in the next section on bridging identities).

At present, documentation and community commentary note that **robust authentication is a missing feature being actively developed** ([How to use Anthropic MCP Server with open LLMs, OpenAI or Google Gemini](https://www.philschmid.de/mcp-example-llama#:~:text=and%20reused%20across%20different%20platforms,the%20need%20to%20copy%20code)). Early adopters treat MCP servers as trusted extensions of their environment (running locally or within a protected context). The expectation is that soon we’ll see standardized auth – possibly API keys per server, or standardized use of OAuth2 for third-party data sources, and perhaps even a registry of public MCP servers that use some key exchange. In any case, if building an MVP, a reasonable approach is to start with a **simple, user-scoped trust** (e.g., only allow the user’s own AI client to connect to their server, maybe by running on localhost or requiring a password) and plan to incorporate more formal auth once the spec or best practices are clarified. Already, best practices like ensuring **credentials are not exposed in logs or error messages, not hard-coding secrets,** and using secure storage for any tokens in the MCP server apply, just as they would in any app connecting to APIs ([Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP): The Standard for AI Interaction - DEV Community](https://dev.to/foxgem/claudes-model-context-protocol-mcp-the-standard-for-ai-interaction-5gko#:~:text=Risks%20and%20Challenges)).

To summarize, **MCP’s current trust model is basic (assume a trusted local environment with user consent), but future iterations will introduce stronger authentication** for remote use cases. An MVP can afford to use a static token or assume local-only usage, but should be designed with an eye toward upgrading to more secure authentication as the protocol evolves ([How to use Anthropic MCP Server with open LLMs, OpenAI or Google Gemini](https://www.philschmid.de/mcp-example-llama#:~:text=and%20reused%20across%20different%20platforms,the%20need%20to%20copy%20code)). 

### Minimum Metadata for an MCP Client to Connect to a Server (MVP Considerations)

For an MCP client (the AI agent side) to connect to and make use of an MCP server, it needs some minimal **metadata/credentials about that server**. In a decentralized or open setting, we want to keep this as light as possible while ensuring trust. The minimum pieces of information an MCP client (or its human operator) must have are:

- **Server Address (Endpoint):** The client needs to know *where* to reach the MCP server. This could be a local identifier (like a filename or port if using STDIO or TCP) or a network address (URI) if remote. For example: “MCP server is available at `tcp://mcp.example.com:4000`” or “use localhost on port 3001” or even a WebSocket URL like `wss://mcp.myserver.io/agent`. Essentially, the endpoint tells the client how to establish the JSON-RPC connection. In an MVP, this might be configured manually (the user enters an address or selects from a list).

- **Server Identity (Optional but Important):** If we are to trust the server, it helps to know *who* or *what* it is. In a closed environment, this may be implicit (“I launched the server, so I trust it”). In an open network, a client would ideally have an identifier for the server, such as a name or DID or fingerprint. For instance, an entry could include a server’s public key or the DID of its owner. At minimum, a human-readable name or description is useful (“Alice’s Bookmark Server”). For an MVP registry, the server’s **declared identity** plus perhaps a reference to how it was verified (e.g., “this server is posted by Alice (did:plc:123)”) could be part of the metadata.

- **Capabilities Summary:** While the client can fetch the full capabilities after connecting (via the initialize call), it might be useful to have a brief summary beforehand, especially if a user is choosing which server to connect to. This could be as simple as a list of tags or a short description provided by the server publisher (e.g., “Offers: Slack and Email tools”). However, strictly speaking, the client doesn’t need this upfront to function – it can connect blind and then retrieve the list of tools. For a smoother UI/UX, though, an MVP might store a one-liner like “MCP Server for GitHub operations” so that users know what they’re connecting to.

- **Authentication Info:** If the server requires a key or token (as discussed above), the client needs that credential. So the metadata should include whatever token or certificate is necessary to authenticate. In a minimal personal setup, this might be omitted (if none required) or could be as straightforward as a password. In a decentralized registry, one might store a public key for the server and use that to verify the server’s identity on connection (the server could prove it owns the corresponding private key during handshake).

Considering a *trusted MVP scenario*, the truly minimal set is **“address + trust context.”** For example: *“Server at `did:example:abc` reachable at `mcp.example.com:4000`”*. Then the client can resolve the DID to get the address (or vice versa, the record might directly have the address) and know that this server is supposed to be owned by a certain entity (the DID owner). The client connects and sends `initialize`. The server responds with its declared info (which can include name, maybe its DID, etc.) and lists of tools/resources ([MCP JSON-RPC Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/p33upo55dp#:~:text=,request)). The client can verify that info if it has a reference (e.g., check that the server’s DID matches the expected one, or if using atproto, confirm the server was announced by the same DID owner). After that, the client loads the actual capabilities: e.g., *N* tools with their JSON schemas, *M* resources, etc. ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=)). 

In practice, when using the MCP in something like Claude or other hosts right now, the **minimum metadata is often provided by the user**: they specify “connect to X server” and that’s enough – the client then does the rest. For a more automated system (like an agent that can discover servers on a network), you’d need a directory of such metadata.

So an MVP metadata structure could be as simple as a record containing:
- a **Locator** (network address or route to find the server),
- an **Identifier** (server name or ID, possibly a DID or the owner’s DID),
- maybe a **Signature or Proof** to ensure authenticity (if we expect impersonation issues).

Everything else (the full list of actions the server can do) comes from the server itself upon connection, thanks to MCP’s self-describing nature ([Engineering AI systems with Model Context Protocol · Raygun Blog](https://raygun.com/blog/announcing-mcp/#:~:text=)) ([MCP JSON-RPC Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/p33upo55dp#:~:text=,request)). This keeps the registry lightweight – it doesn’t need to store all details of the server’s capabilities, just enough for someone to connect to it and trust that connection. The heavy lifting of describing every tool is done by the MCP protocol once the client is connected.

In summary, the minimum viable metadata for an MCP client to query a trusted server is essentially *how to reach it and who vouches for it*. With that, the client can initiate the MCP handshake and obtain the rest of the needed info directly from the server. This minimalism aligns with decentralization: a registry (like on atproto) wouldn’t dictate or duplicate all server details, it would just point you in the right direction securely.

## Interoperability and MVP Feasibility – Bridging AT Protocol and MCP

Now we bring the two threads together: how might AT Protocol serve as a **decentralized registry and trust fabric** for MCP nodes, and what would a hyper-minimal MVP of that look like? There’s a natural synergy here: atproto provides decentralized identity, distribution, and data storage, while MCP provides the interface for AI-to-tool communication. Using atproto to coordinate MCP servers could give us a decentralized “yellow pages” for AI services, leveraging atproto’s identity and social graph for trust and discovery.

### AT Protocol as a Decentralized Registry for MCP Nodes

**Publishing MCP Server Info via ATProto:** Atproto’s lexicon system allows defining new record types, so one could create a schema (say, `app.mcp.registry` or similar) for announcing an MCP service. For example, a user (identified by their DID/handle on atproto) could create a record in their repository that contains the key metadata of their MCP server – such as the server’s network address (URI), a name/description, and perhaps a public key or other identifier. Once published, this record is part of that user’s atproto data, which means it’s **signed by them, visible to the network, and globally addressable** via their DID and the record’s key ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Data%3A%20public%20content%20is%20stored,signed%20and%20distributed%20outside%20repositories)). Because atproto content is **globally broadcast in the network’s firehose** ([Call for Developer Projects · bluesky-social atproto · Discussion #3049 · GitHub](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions/3049#:~:text=the%20range%20from%20helper%20tools,to%20full%20applications)), any aggregator or interested client could collect these MCP server announcements. In effect, every user could advertise “I have an MCP server running here,” and there’s no central authority needed beyond the atproto network itself (which is federated). This achieves a decentralized registry: it’s just a collection of user-published statements, which can be queried or indexed.

**Identity Linking and Discovery:** With atproto as the medium, the registry entries automatically inherit the trust properties of atproto identities. Each entry is tied to a DID (the publisher’s). If Alice publishes an MCP server record, it’s clear it came from Alice’s atproto account (thanks to signatures). If her handle is `alice.com` (verified via DNS), you now also know the MCP server is endorsed by the owner of that domain – a strong trust signal. To discover MCP nodes, one could use atproto’s search or subscription mechanisms. An **indexer service** could filter the global stream for records of the MCP type and build an index. Because lexicons can be **reused and standardized**, multiple such records from various users would all share the same schema, making it easy to aggregate them. In an MVP, it might be as simple as a script subscribing to the network’s event feed and printing all new “MCP registry” records.

**Interoperability via Common Schemas:** Both atproto and MCP emphasize schema-driven design. We could define the MCP registry schema to include fields like `endpointURL`, `ownerDid` (implicitly the record’s author), `serviceDid` or key (if the server has its own DID or key), `capabilityTags` (a list of keywords like “database”, “slack”, “email” to hint at what it can do), etc. This schema, once agreed upon, could be used by any atproto-compatible service. For instance, one could build a Bluesky app view that specifically indexes these records and provides an API to query “find MCP servers offering X”. Or even without a dedicated indexer, a user could find an MCP server through social means – maybe Alice shares the AT URI of her MCP server record in a post, or people in a community follow a certain account that curates a list of MCP servers. The key advantage is that the *registry entries are living data on a decentralized network*, not siloed in one company’s database.

**Benefits of atproto for this use case:**
- *Decentralization:* No single point of failure or control; anyone can publish their MCP service info, and it propagates through the network.
- *Authentication:* Because records are signed by DIDs, you can cryptographically verify who published a given MCP server listing ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=Identity%3A%20account%20control%20is%20rooted,and%20mutable%20identifier%20for%20accounts)). This helps ensure authenticity – if a malicious actor tries to impersonate someone else’s service, they wouldn’t have the right DID/private key.
- *Discoverability:* The atproto network is designed to handle lots of data and make it discoverable (the paper cites “discoverability” as a goal ([AT Protocol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol#:~:text=The%20AT%20Protocol%20aims%20to,80%20content%20formatted%20as%20predefined))). Through global indexing or social discovery, MCP services can be found by interested users or agents. And since atproto scales to potentially billions of accounts ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=%2A%20Self,primitives%20from%20the%20web%20platform)), it could handle a large directory of services.
- *Interlinking with Social Graph:* Perhaps most interestingly, one could leverage the social aspect – e.g., you might trust or prefer MCP servers run by people you follow or by well-known organizations. If a user account is followed by many (as a sign of reputation) and they publish a server, that might lend credibility. Conversely, spam MCP server records could be down-ranked or labeled by moderation services (again using atproto’s labeling system to mark fraudulent entries).

In a hyper-minimal MVP, we might skip full automation of discovery and simply have a known list of a few atproto DIDs who post MCP entries, but the mechanism would be there to scale out. 

### Bridging Authentication: ATProto Identities and MCP Agent Trust

One challenge in a distributed registry is ensuring that knowing “Alice (DID:X) says her server is at location Y” translates into a secure connection to that server. Here’s where we create a bridge between atproto identity and MCP authentication:

**Using DID for MCP Server Identity:** We can give the MCP server itself an identity. For example, if Alice’s atproto DID is did:plc:1234... (which has her public key), she could have her MCP server use the *same* key pair or an associated one. In practice, the MCP server could be configured to know “I am representing Alice.” When the MCP client (the AI) connects, it can challenge the server to prove its identity – e.g., sign a nonce with Alice’s key. Since the atproto record told the client that this server is supposed to belong to Alice’s DID, the client can verify the signature against Alice’s public key (obtained via DID resolution) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=unique%20identifier%3A%20a%20decentralized%20ID,DIDs%20are%20a%20recent%20W3C)). If it matches, the client is assured this server is indeed controlled by Alice (or at least by whoever has Alice’s private key). This links nicely: the trust in the DID is bootstrapped by atproto’s infrastructure (and possibly DNS), so if you trust that, you now trust the MCP server’s authenticity.

**Atproto Authentication Delegation:** Another angle is using atproto’s OAuth-like mechanisms. Atproto spec includes an account/auth system (users authenticate to their PDS, possibly via app passwords or OAuth flows) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=,NSID)). We might leverage that by having an AI client authenticate as a certain atproto user and then be authorized to access that user’s MCP server. For instance, if the MCP server knows it should only accept connections from the owner, the AI client could present an atproto JWT (JSON web token) or some proof that it’s acting on behalf of Alice. There is a **proposal in atproto for OAuth** ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=,NSID)) which could be repurposed: essentially, the AI would log in to atproto as Alice (perhaps the user gives it an app password), and then when connecting to the MCP server, it includes a token signed by Alice’s PDS attesting to her identity. The server verifies this token (maybe by checking with the PDS or verifying the signature with PDS’s key), ensuring the client is indeed Alice’s agent.

For an MVP, a simpler approach might be:
- The MCP server expects a secret that was published in the atproto record in encrypted form (only the intended client can decrypt). But that might be overkill initially.
- Or just assume the atproto identity itself is enough context: e.g., if the AI is part of Alice’s client app, it knows it’s Alice’s agent, and the server just trusts local connections. 

**Agent Trust Mechanisms:** Another facet is trust *by the AI agent* – ensuring it only connects to reputable MCP servers. Through atproto, the agent can assess trust: was this server announced by a DID I trust? Perhaps the user maintains a list of “approved service providers” or there are community labels (again using atproto’s label system) marking some server records as dangerous or safe. For instance, if someone publishes a malicious MCP server that actually deletes your files when asked to read them, a moderation service could label that record as malicious. The AI client can check the atproto labels on the record’s URI ([Labels - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/label#:~:text=Labels%20primarily%20consist%20of%20a,clarify%20which%20label%20is%20current)) and warn or avoid connecting if it’s flagged. This is a decentralized way to handle reputation of services – exactly what atproto excels at (third-party labeling).

In short, bridging authentication could mean **using atproto’s identities and cryptography to secure MCP interactions**. The user’s DID (with its associated keys) becomes the anchor: the MCP server and client can both use that to validate each other. The *client* proves who the user is (so the server can ensure it’s serving an authorized user), and the *server* proves it’s the genuine service that the user (through atproto) advertised. Implementing this might involve some custom coding (since it’s cross-protocol), but conceptually it leans on existing pieces: DID documents (for public keys) ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=unique%20identifier%3A%20a%20decentralized%20ID,DIDs%20are%20a%20recent%20W3C)), signed challenges, and atproto’s signed records.

For an MVP, we might implement a very basic version: e.g., the atproto registry record includes a field like `challengeString`. When the AI connects, it asks the server to echo back that string signed with Alice’s private key. The AI verifies via Alice’s DID key. If okay, then proceed. This doesn’t require a fully fleshed OAuth or token system – just a manual challenge – and it could be enough to demonstrate the principle of **linked trust**. 

### Lessons from Existing Decentralized Registries for a Hyper-Minimal MVP

When designing a minimal viable product that combines these systems, it’s useful to heed lessons from other decentralized registry attempts:

- **Don’t Reinvent the Wheel (Leverage DNS/DID):** Many decentralized networks use DNS as a bootstrap (e.g., Mastodon uses Webfinger with DNS, Secure Scuttlebutt used domain verification for identities, etc.). Atproto already integrates with DNS for handles ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=To%20prove%20ownership%20of%20a,handle%2C%20as%20shown%20in%20Figure%C2%A02)), and uses DIDs for identity. Our MVP should lean on these instead of creating a new naming system. That means using domain-based handles or well-known DIDs to identify services, so that, for example, if the “Alice’s MCP server” is at `mcp.alice.com`, the domain itself vouches for it. This is similar to how **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)** maps names to addresses publicly – we can use atproto records to map handles to service endpoints publicly. The advantage of DNS/ENS is human readability and a built-in trust model (ownership of a name). By using atproto (which in turn can use DNS for handles), we piggyback on an established decentralized naming system, keeping the MVP simpler.

- **Simplicity and Clarity in Schema:** A common pitfall in decentralized registries is overloading the schema with too much info (which can become stale or hard to validate). A lean schema that just contains the essentials (as discussed: endpoint, maybe key, description) will be easier to adopt. We can take cues from something like the **ActivityPub `Discoverability`** (which uses Webfinger to map username@domain to a profile JSON) – it’s minimalist (just returns the profile’s pointer). Our atproto-based approach can be similarly minimal – essentially mapping an atproto DID to an MCP endpoint. The actual capabilities of that endpoint are left to MCP’s dynamic discovery, which is analogous to how ActivityPub then fetches the actor’s profile separately. Keeping responsibilities separated (atproto for who/where, MCP for what/how) is an important design lesson for clarity.

- **Use Existing Infrastructure for Distribution:** Rather than building a custom DHT or gossip network to share server info, using atproto’s **firehose/relay** system means we benefit from a robust, scalable distribution mechanism ([Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03239v2#:~:text=match%20at%20L468%20replica%20of,latency%20notifications)). In our MVP, all we need is to ensure our records get into the firehose (if they’re public, they will by default). A simple indexer can subscribe to the atproto event stream (Bluesky provides an API for this) ([AT Protocol - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/atp#:~:text=referenced%20across%20the%20network%20by,outputs%20a%20unified%20event%20Firehose)) and filter for our record type. This is far easier than, say, writing a whole peer-to-peer discovery layer from scratch. The lesson: build on proven distribution layers (like how BitTorrent uses trackers or how Mastodon instances communicate known peers). Here, the “tracker” is essentially the atproto network itself.

- **Gradual Trust – Start Closed, Open Up Carefully:** Many decentralized projects start with a semi-centralized directory for bootstrapping (e.g., early Mastodon instances lists, or Bitcoin initially had a built-in list of seed nodes) and then decentralize further. For an MVP, it’s acceptable to, for instance, have a known “MCP directory account” on Bluesky that curates entries initially, or to manually approve a handful of servers to populate the system. This provides a controlled environment to test the idea. Over time, you remove that central crutch and rely more on organic discovery and trust labels. The key is to design the system such that this centralization is optional – as we’ve done by using open protocols. If the MVP has, say, one well-known indexer service for convenience, ensure the data format is open so others can run their own indexers.

- **Federation and Moderation Considerations:** In a decentralized registry, not every server listed will be benign. We should anticipate needing moderation: e.g., someone might list fake services or offensive descriptions. Atproto’s moderation primitives (labels, block lists) can be directly applied here. For instance, a moderation service could assign a label “spam” to MCP records that are known bad, and clients can filter those out ([Labels - AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/specs/label#:~:text=The%20label%20concept%20and%20protocol,other%20purposes%20in%20atproto%20applications)). The MVP can start with a simple approach (maybe only allow entries from known users), but having a plan to incorporate these moderation tools will make it robust. This mirrors lessons from package managers (like npm or PyPI) which are open registries that ended up needing ways to flag or remove malicious packages. Since atproto allows community-driven moderation, we can use that rather than inventing our own moderation system.

**Hyper-Minimal Implementation Outline:** Bringing it all together, a minimal working prototype might involve:
1. Define an atproto lexicon **`app.mcp.server`** with fields: `serviceDid` (or implicitly the author’s DID), `endpoint` (string URL or multiaddr), `description` (short text), maybe `pubKey` (if not using author’s DID for auth).
2. Run a small atproto-compatible PDS or use an existing one to create a few records in this schema (e.g., Alice and Bob each publish one, describing their MCP servers).
3. Implement a basic **client-side script or service** that uses the Bluesky API to pull these records. This could use `com.atproto.repo.getRecords` for a specific user or an Event stream to catch all new records globally. For MVP, even pulling specific known users is fine.
4. Have an **AI agent (or a simulation)** that reads one of these records, extracts the endpoint, and attempts an MCP connection (perhaps using a known MCP client library or a simple JSON-RPC client). It then goes through MCP’s `initialize` flow to get capabilities ([MCP JSON-RPC Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/p33upo55dp#:~:text=,request)), and possibly invokes a test tool to show it works.
5. (Optional) Demonstrate a trust check: e.g., the AI verifies that the record’s author DID matches some expected identity for the server. Or showcase that if a record is labeled negatively, the AI skips it.
6. Use this flow to show, for example, that one can switch out the MCP service by simply pointing to a different atproto record (e.g., Bob’s instead of Alice’s) and the AI dynamically adjusts to the new tools because it redid the discovery. This highlights the interoperability and decoupling of concerns.

Through this, we’d validate that atproto can serve as the discovery layer and identity provider, while MCP serves as the execution layer for AI tools. The MVP doesn’t need to solve every problem (it can assume the entries are trustworthy and the connections are allowed), but it lays the foundation: a user can publish a service advertisement on a decentralized network, and an AI can automatically pick it up and use that service. Scaling from there would involve adding more automation (like searching by capability tags), more security (authentication handshake using DID keys), and more community inputs (rating services, etc.), all of which the architecture naturally supports.

In conclusion, leveraging AT Protocol as a registry for MCP nodes marries the strengths of both systems: **atproto provides decentralized identity, discovery, and trust frameworks, and MCP provides a standardized way for AIs to interface with services**. With a careful but minimal integration, we can enable a world where anyone can announce an AI-accessible service and anyone else’s AI can find and use it – all without central gatekeepers. This forms a solid foundation for a truly open ecosystem of AI tools, which an MVP project can begin to demonstrate today.
